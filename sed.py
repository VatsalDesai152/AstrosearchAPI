"""Multi-wavelength object passport: spectral energy distribution (SED), classification, and redshift.

Pipeline
--------
1. Crossmatch the position (or a resolved name) with :class:`crossmatch.CrossmatchService`, or take an
   existing ``UnifiedRecord`` dict.
2. Pool the rows of ALL crossmatch groups and take, per catalog, the row within that catalog's positional tolerance
   (astrometry (+) epoch-propagation growth, or resolution), preferring the target's own group (``contains_target``
   of the Bayesian association, else the group with most survey catalogs in tolerance), then the nearest. The
   association may split one object over several groups (high proper-motion stars, a Gaia nucleus in its own
   group, a group of name-resolver rows at 0 arcsec); rows used from other groups, and in-tolerance rows passed
   over, are reported in ``notes``. SIMBAD rows: the Sesame-resolved identifier first, planets ('Pl') never
   replace their host; NED rows: object-level entries before absorbers/sub-components. A 2MASS/AllWISE/Gaia DR3 row
   whose designation ('2MASS J...', 'WISEA J...', 'Gaia DR3 ...') is a name of the object resolved by Sesame is the
   object even beyond the positional tolerance (proper-motion offsets between mislabelled catalogue epochs).
3. Extract every photometric measurement present in those members (Gaia DR3 G/BP/RP, 2MASS JHKs,
   AllWISE W1-W4, Pan-STARRS1 grizy, SDSS ugriz, GALEX FUV/NUV, SIMBAD literature V, radio flux densities
   from FIRST/NVSS/VLASS/LoTSS, X-ray fluxes from ROSAT/Chandra/XMM-Newton) and convert them to flux
   densities in Jy with propagated 1-sigma errors, nu*F_nu in erg s^-1 cm^-2, and upper-limit flags.
4. Collect redshifts (SDSS SpecObj/Photoz via SkyServer SQL, NED, SIMBAD) and pick the best one.
5. Classify the object (star / qso / galaxy / agn) from transparent, individually-weighted evidence.

Photometric calibration
-----------------------
* Filter effective wavelengths and Vega zero points come from the SVO Filter Profile Service
  (Rodrigo & Solano 2020, "The SVO Filter Profile Service", XXX Reunion Bienal de la SEA, 182;
  Rodrigo, Solano & Bayo 2012, IVOA Working Draft). The service lives at
  ``https://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/fps/fps.php`` (the host ``svo2.cab.inaf.es`` does not resolve).
  Answers are validated (finite ZeroPoint > 0 in Jy with PhotCalID '<filter>/Vega', WavelengthEff > 0) before
  they are cached on disk; malformed answers or cache entries are never used. A request waits at most
  ``FilterCatalog.deadline_seconds`` for SVO; :data:`EMBEDDED_FILTERS`, copied verbatim from live SVO responses
  retrieved 2026-09-28, serves every filter SVO has not answered for.
* AB magnitudes (Pan-STARRS1: Tonry et al. 2012, ApJ 750, 99; SDSS: Fukugita et al. 1996, AJ 111, 1748;
  GALEX: Morrissey et al. 2007, ApJS 173, 682) use the defining AB zero point F_nu = 3631 Jy
  (Oke & Gunn 1983, ApJ 266, 713): m_AB = -2.5 log10(F_nu / 3631 Jy). SVO's per-filter "AB" ZeroPoint
  (e.g. 3767.2 Jy for SDSS u) is tied to SVO's own effective-wavelength convention and is *not* used.
* SDSS magnitudes are asinh magnitudes (Lupton, Gunn & Szalay 1999, AJ 118, 1406) with softening
  parameters b = (1.4, 0.9, 1.2, 1.8, 7.4) x 1e-10 for ugriz and AB offsets u_AB = u_SDSS - 0.04 and
  z_AB = z_SDSS + 0.02 (SDSS DR17 "Magnitudes" and "Flux calibration" algorithm pages).
* Vega magnitudes (Gaia DR3: Riello et al. 2021, A&A 649, A3; 2MASS: Cohen, Wheaton & Megeath 2003,
  AJ 126, 1090; WISE: Jarrett et al. 2011, ApJ 735, 112) use the SVO Vega zero points.
* Radio flux densities are taken as published (FIRST: Becker et al. 1995 / Helfand et al. 2015, integrated
  1.4 GHz flux in mJy; NVSS: Condon et al. 1998, 1.4 GHz, mJy; VLASS epoch 1 (Bruzewski et al. 2021),
  3 GHz, Jy; LoTSS (Shimwell et al.), 144 MHz, mJy).
* X-ray band fluxes F (erg s^-1 cm^-2 in [E1, E2]) are converted to a flux density at the logarithmic
  band centre E0 = sqrt(E1 E2) ASSUMING a power law with photon index Gamma = 2 (N(E) ~ E^-Gamma), the
  canonical AGN value (e.g. Nandra & Pounds 1994, MNRAS 268, 405): F_E(E) = K E^(1-Gamma) with
  F = integral_E1^E2 F_E dE, so for Gamma = 2, F_E(E0) = F / (E0 ln(E2/E1)) and nu F_nu = F / ln(E2/E1).
  ROSAT PSPC count rates (0.1-2.4 keV) use the UNABSORBED energy conversion factor from HEASARC
  WebPIMMS v4.15a (Gamma = 2, N_H = 3e20 cm^-2): 1 ct/s = 1.877e-11 erg s^-1 cm^-2 unabsorbed
  (1.135e-11 absorbed), so the ROSAT point is the level of the intrinsic Gamma = 2 power law, i.e.
  corrected for an assumed Galactic N_H = 3e20 cm^-2. The true N_H varies with sight line
  (1e20 to >1e22 cm^-2); at 0.49 keV this is the dominant systematic (a factor ~1.7 between the
  absorbed and unabsorbed normalisations for N_H = 3e20). Chandra and XMM-Newton band fluxes are
  the catalogues' observed fluxes (absorption at 3e20 cm^-2 is small above 0.5 keV).

Photometric quality
-------------------
Points carry ``quality_warning`` (and the reason in ``warnings``) when the catalogue flags the measurement: 2MASS/WISE
ph_qual E/F/X, AllWISE profile-fit magnitudes brighter than 2.0, 1.5, -3.0, -4.0 mag in W1-W4 (the limit of reliable
profile fitting of saturated sources, WISE All-Sky Explanatory Supplement VI.3.d), W1 < 8 / W2 < 7 at the ecliptic
longitudes observed in the NEOWISE post-cryo phase (AllWISE Explanatory Supplement II.2.c.i), 'U' limits brighter than
the nominal saturation limits 8, 7, 3.8, 0.4 mag (II.2.c.iii; a failed extraction, not a limit), WISE points more than
5x below the Rayleigh-Jeans extrapolation of a shorter 2MASS/WISE band, SDSS SATURATED per-band flags (or psfMag < 14 when the flags could not be fetched;
Riello et al. 2021 App. C: SDSS sources brighter than 14 mag are saturated), Pan-STARRS1 mean PSF
magnitudes brighter than the single-exposure saturation limits g, r, i 13.5, z 13.0, y 12.0 (Magnier
et al. 2013, ApJS 205, 20) or qualityFlag without QF_OBJ_GOOD, Gaia BP/RP when the corrected flux
excess |C*| > 3 sigma_C*(G) (Riello et al. 2021, Eqs. 6 and 18, Table 2), Chandra pile-up/saturation,
LoTSS points implying a rising 144 MHz -> 1.4 GHz spectrum, and SIMBAD literature V magnitudes
inconsistent with Gaia (G - V from BP - RP, Riello et al. 2021 Table C.2). Flagged points stay in the
SED but are never used by the classification rules.

Classification evidence
-----------------------
Gaia DR3 astrometry (parallax_over_error > 5 or proper motion > 5 sigma, only when RUWE < 1.4:
Lindegren et al. 2021, A&A 649, A2; the proper-motion errors include the 33 uas/yr RMS small-scale
systematics quoted in Gaia Collaboration, Vallenari et al. 2023, Sect. 3.3, plus the 80 uas/yr
bright-star frame bias for G < 13, Cantat-Gaudin & Brandt 2021; a significant motion counts fully only
above 1 mas/yr, weakly at 0.2-1 mas/yr where structured/variable quasars show spurious motions, and not at
all below 5 mas/yr when astrometric_excess_noise_sig > 2), Gaia DR3 DSC class probabilities
(Delchambre et al. 2023, A&A 674, A31) and qso/galaxy candidate membership, WISE W1-W2 >= 0.8 Vega
(Stern et al. 2012, ApJ 753, 30; valid for W2 < 15.05) and the WISE colour-colour loci (Wright et al.
2010, AJ 140, 1868) using only ph_qual A/B bands, radio loudness R_i = log10(F_1.4GHz / F_i) > 1
(Ivezic et al. 2002, AJ 124, 2364; defined for point-like optical counterparts -- for extended ones a
total optical magnitude is used and the rule is down-weighted), X-ray-to-optical ratio
log(fX/fV) = log fX + V/2.5 + 5.37 > -1 (Maccacaro et al. 1988, ApJ 326, 680; Stocke et al. 1991,
ApJS 76, 813), the QSO luminosity criterion M_i < -22 (Schneider et al. 2010, AJ 139, 2360; point-like
counterparts only), SDSS morphology/spectral class, AllWISE association with a 2MASS extended source
(ext_flg 2-5; ext_flg 1 is only a poor PSF fit) and SIMBAD / NED object types (NED sub-component rows such
as absorbers are never taken as the object). SIMBAD types are mapped through the otypedef hierarchy (``G > AGN >
QSO`` -> qso, ``G > AGN`` -> agn, ``G`` -> galaxy, ``*`` -> star), never by the look of the code: supernovae/novae
are transients (not class-specific), 'Sy?' is a symbiotic-star candidate. A NED stellar type on a row whose own
redshift exceeds 1017 km/s is ignored. SDSS morphology of saturated objects (type 3 of saturated stars) is not used,
and the WISE W1-W2 AGN colour is not applied to objects with a significant parallax/proper motion (brown dwarfs).
For extended counterparts the X-ray/optical ratio uses the total optical light, and a quasar/blazar catalogue type
counts as a quasar only when the nucleus can be quasar-luminous at the adopted redshift (otherwise as an AGN in its
host: Cygnus A, NGC 1275); the ratio is not AGN evidence for a star with a Gaia or SIMBAD parallax/proper motion, and an
X-ray row that a brighter neighbouring Gaia source is closer to (after proper-motion propagation over the X-ray
observations) is flagged. Every piece of
evidence is reported with its weight; scores are a softmax over summed weights, so the output is a
transparent heuristic, not a calibrated probability; ties are reported and resolved explicitly: an extended
counterpart prefers galaxy/agn (unless the adopted redshift is a quasar's and a galaxy at it would exceed the quasar
luminosity M < -22), otherwise the class of the entry whose redshift was adopted, otherwise 'unknown'. When the result is 'star', redshift-based rules are dropped and a redshift
|cz| > 1017 km/s (above the fastest known field/hypervelocity star, a heuristic not applied near Sgr A*) is
reported as conflicting.

Redshift
--------
Kinds are never guessed: SDSS SpecObj (zWarning = 0 is reliable, a null zWarning is unknown), NED zflag
(S = spec, P = photo, other codes = unknown technique but NED-vetted), SIMBAD rvz_nature ('s*' = spec,
'p' = photo; a radial velocity with a null nature = spec; quality A-D reliable, E unreliable whatever the nature)
fetched from SIMBAD TAP. See :data:`_REDSHIFT_PRIORITY`: a photometric redshift never outranks a catalogue-vetted
value. Every non-photometric value not flagged by its catalogue -- vetted, or of unknown quality because its lookup
failed -- is cross-checked (|dz|/(1+z) > 0.01 is a discordance): a vetted value corroborated by a second catalogue or
an SDSS zWarning = 0 spectrum, or else the only vetted value consistent with the redshift-independent classification
(a small or negative cz is never ruled out for a galaxy), is adopted; otherwise the redshift is reported as a conflict
(reliable = False), with every discordant value listed in ``redshift.discordant`` (``vetted`` False: its quality
could not be checked). Gaia/SIMBAD TAP lookups retry transient failures (3 attempts, as providers.py); rate limits
(HTTP 429, Retry-After) back the archive off.

Identification
--------------
Names are resolved with Sesame '-oxpI' (all identifiers; the configured $SESAME_ENDPOINT with the 'I' option added): a
2MASS/AllWISE/Gaia DR3 row whose designation is one of the object's names is the object even beyond the positional
tolerance (fast-moving stars at mismatched epochs). A record resolved without identifiers (the app's own '-oxp'
crossmatch) gets them from Sesame before the members are chosen.

    position labelled J2000: at 2.26 arcsec/yr its own 2MASS row comes out 2.5 arcsec away after epoch propagation).

    within tolerance.

    Radio catalogs (FIRST/NVSS/VLASS/LoTSS) collect *components*: every row within tolerance is summed, and
    a pair of components on opposite sides of ``centre`` (the target position) is accepted as a lobe pair
    even beyond the tolerance, so extended double sources (e.g. Cygnus A) keep their radio emission.

    Members are taken per catalog from every crossmatch group (:func:`select_record_members`). ``supplementary``
    enables the extra lookups (SVO filter metadata for filters not cached yet, Gaia DR3 errors/DSC probabilities/
    BP-RP excess, SDSS SpecObj/Photoz near the object, the SDSS member's all-band photometry/flags/zWarning, SIMBAD
    redshift nature/quality and flux errors). They share ONE deadline (``deadline_seconds``, default
    :func:`default_supplementary_deadline`) and a per-host back-off (``backoff``, default :func:`default_backoff`);
    each failure is reported in ``notes`` and the SED is still built (embedded filter table, missing Gaia errors,
    member columns only, redshift kinds/reliabilities left unknown rather than guessed). ``radius_arcsec`` is reported
    as the search radius when the record's provenance does not state it.

    A record resolved by name without the object's identifiers (the app's own crossmatch resolves with Sesame '-oxp',
    which lists none) gets them first from Sesame '-oxpI' (:func:`_with_sesame_aliases`, within the same deadline), so
    survey rows are still identified by designation. ``background_filter_fetches`` lets SVO fetches still running at
    the filter deadline finish (and be cached) after the call; the default allows it only on a caller-supplied
    client, which is assumed to stay open (pass False when the client is closed right after the call).
