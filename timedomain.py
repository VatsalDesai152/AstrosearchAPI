"""Time-domain astronomy: multi-survey light curves, variability metrics, periods, solar-system check.

Data sources (every endpoint and parameter below was verified against the live
services; see ``tests/fixtures/timedomain`` for recorded responses):

* **ZTF** -- object IDs from the IRSA TAP table ``ztf_objects_drNN`` (newest
  release, discovered from TAP_SCHEMA), photometry from the IRSA ZTF light-curve
  API ``nph_light_curves`` by ID (Masci et al. 2019, PASP 131, 018003). PSF-fit
  magnitudes calibrated to Pan-STARRS1 (AB) in g/r/i; only epochs with
  ``catflags == 0`` and a PSF fit (chi, sharp) consistent with the object's other
  epochs are used for statistics. For moving targets every epoch's measured position
  must follow the target's motion.
* **NEOWISE-R** -- IRSA TAP table ``neowiser_p1bs_psd`` (Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ
  792, 30). Single exposures are cleaned with the NEOWISE Explanatory Supplement
  (sec. II.3) cuts and averaged per ~6-monthly visit (W1/W2, Vega magnitudes);
  single exposures are available with ``neowise_binned=False``.
* **Gaia DR3** -- epoch photometry via the Gaia archive DataLink service (Eyer et
  al. 2023, A&A 674, A13; Riello et al. 2021, A&A 649, A3) for the nearest DR3
  source with ``has_epoch_photometry``; G, BP and RP (Vega).
* **TESS** -- SPOC 2-min light curves from MAST (Jenkins et al. 2016, SPIE 9913):
  PDCSAP flux, or SAP flux for sectors where PDCSAP is unphysical (<= 0), each
  normalised by its sector median (optional survey; ~2 MB download per sector;
  stars without SPOC 2-min data, i.e. FFI-only targets, are not covered).
* **Solar system** -- IMCCE SkyBoT cone search (Berthier et al. 2006, ASP Conf.
  Ser. 351, 367; 2016, MNRAS 458, 3394), plus a JPL Horizons API helper
  (Giorgini et al. 1996) for independent ephemeris checks.

All epochs are converted to Barycentric Dynamical Time at the solar-system
barycentre and reported as ``BMJD_TDB = BJD_TDB - 2400000.5`` so series from
different surveys share one time axis (Eastman et al. 2010, PASP 122, 935).

Variability metrics follow Sokolovsky et al. (2017, MNRAS 464, 274): weighted
mean, chi^2 vs a constant, robust 5-95 % amplitude, von Neumann eta (von Neumann
1941), Stetson J (Stetson 1996, PASP 108, 851) and normalised excess variance
(Vaughan et al. 2003, MNRAS 345, 1271). Per-epoch errors follow survey error models
calibrated on constant stars (:data:`ERROR_MODELS`: Stripe 82 standards for ZTF and
NEOWISE, Gaia GAPS sources and Evans et al. 2023 for Gaia G, RV-quiet dwarfs for TESS); the decision rule is
described in :data:`VARIABILITY_CRITERIA`. Periods use the generalised Lomb-Scargle
periodogram (Zechmeister & Kuerster 2009; VanderPlas 2018, ApJS 236, 16) with
Baluev (2008, MNRAS 385, 1279) false-alarm probabilities, a shared-frequency
multi-band periodogram (VanderPlas & Ivezic 2015, ApJ 812, 18), a period-doubling
test for eclipsing/ellipsoidal binaries (cluster-robust even/odd-cycle ANOVA and odd
harmonics of f/2, BIC; Schwarz 1978, Kass & Raftery 1995) and multi-harmonic refinement
with Montgomery & O'Donoghue (1999) uncertainties, inflated for correlated residuals
(red-noise continuum, effective N, time-block sandwich). False-alarm probabilities
account for red noise and are checked on rank-transformed data (outlier-robust).

Positions: a target epoch and proper motion (e.g. from name resolution) are
propagated to each survey's epoch (Gaia J2016.0, TIC J2000.0, ZTF mid-survey with a
widened cone, NEOWISE per exposure).

    target with epoch and proper motion, of its track over

    neighbour is never adopted in place of a target that ZTF did not measure (e.g. a
    saturated star, whose own objects have ``ngoodobs = 0``). Each returned row carries
    ``_sep`` (arcsec, to the target or its track).

    A star is one object per reference image, so for a stationary target only the

    (e.g. the objects along Barnard's star's 80" track, 4-65" from the star at their

    ``binned=False`` returns the cleaned single exposures instead (``n`` = 1).

    Source association: in each frame (one ``mjd``) the detection nearest the target
    is used, and only if it lies within ``match_arcsec`` (default 3", half the W1/W2
    PSF FWHM) of the target position *at that frame's epoch* (proper motion applied
    when ``target`` carries one) -- whatever the cone radius -- so a neighbour never

    (non-detections) are dropped. A visit is used only when at least half of the band's
    detections in it (and >= 3) pass: persistence and other artefacts affect whole
    visits, and the few exposures escaping the flags are biased too.

    Saturation (Explanatory Supplement sec. II.1.c): in a kept visit whose median
    magnitude is brighter than :data:`NEOWISE_SATURATION_MAG`, every exposure is
    saturated; elsewhere an exposure with saturated pixels (``w1sat`` / ``w2sat`` > 0) is.
    A visit left with fewer than 3 unsaturated exposures counts as saturated. Saturated
    exposures are always returned (binned per visit like the good ones) with flag
    :data:`NEOWISE_SATURATED_FLAG` = 3 so they can be plotted, and are never used for
    statistics (variability, period search).

    ``include_flagged`` also returns the rejected single exposures of the target (flag 1:
    failed the exposure cuts; flag 2: passed but in a rejected visit), never binned and

    Non-parametric analysis of variance in phase (cf. Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1989, MNRAS

    low-order Fourier model cannot represent. For each band, the data are folded at
    P = 1/frequency and split by cycle parity (even/odd cycles, i.e. the two halves of
    a fold at 2P). A fine binned-median profile at P is subtracted first (so steep
    branches do not bias the comparison); then in every phase bin the residuals of even
    and odd cycles are compared with a one-way ANOVA F test, whose p-value uses that
    bin's own scatter (eclipse bins are far noisier than out-of-eclipse bins). The
    per-bin p-values are combined as sum chi2_1-quantiles (a chi^2 with one degree of
    freedom per bin), giving ``sigma`` (Gaussian-equivalent significance).

    Cluster-robust: parity is a property of a cycle, and the epochs of one cycle taken in
    one observing run (:func:`observing_runs`; e.g. the 2-4 same-night ZTF exposures that
    fall into one phase bin) share that cycle's deviation from the mean profile -- the
    amplitude/phase modulation of a Blazhko RR Lyrae, spots, a night's zero point. They
    are one observation of the cycle, not independent ones, so each (run, cycle)
    cluster's mean residual in a bin is one ANOVA sample (treating them as independent
    doubled the periods of modulated pulsators up to 8x, e.g. V354 Lyr).

    ``effect`` is the rms of the even-odd difference of the bin means (noise-debiased)
    relative to the rms of the profile, i.e. how different consecutive cycles are in
    units of the variability amplitude (unequal eclipse depths give 0.1-1; cycle-to-cycle

    all low frequencies. Following Vaughan (2005, A&A 431, 391), the noise level is
    estimated from the data at the frequency of interest: the K-harmonic model is
    removed, and the continuum S(f) of the residuals' Lomb-Scargle periodogram ('psd'
    normalisation, = half the chi^2 reduction of a sinusoid, Exp(1)-distributed for white
    noise with correct errors; S = 1 then) is fitted in [f/3, 3f] (:func:`_local_continuum`),
    excluding +-2/T around f and around each fitted harmonic j f: the fit removed the
    residual power there, and those holes in ln P pulled the continuum of the red-noise
    Seyfert Mrk 817 down from ~950x to 540x the white level, making a 277-d red-noise peak

    Aliased red noise: the sampling window peaks at ``alias_centres``
    (:func:`window_alias_centres`; from the ground 1 c/d, the sidereal day and their +-1/yr
    side lobes), and each window peak c carries the low-frequency (red-noise) power at nu to
    c +- nu -- a narrow band of steep, strong power around 1 c/d that a continuum fitted over
    [f/3, 3f] misses (damped random walks on the real ZTF times of Mrk 817 gave "reliable"
    ~0.999-d periods with FAPs of 1e-9 to 1e-15). For every harmonic j f within
    :data:`RED_NOISE_ALIAS_MAX_OFFSET` of a centre c the aliased level W(c) S(nu) is
    computed -- W the normalised window power (:func:`spectral_window_power`), S(nu) the
    continuum of the data's own periodogram at nu = |j f - c| (at least 1/T; the signal's
    harmonics and their aliases excluded) -- and the continuum used is the largest of S(f)
    and these levels.

    The signal statistic Q = (chi2_0 - chi2_K) / (2 S) is Gamma(K, 1)-distributed for
    noise with that spectral density; the single-frequency probability p = P(Gamma(K) > Q)
    is converted to a FAP over the M = (f_max - f_min) T independent frequencies searched
    (FAP = 1 - (1 - p)^M; Horne & Baliunas 1986, ApJ 302, 757). Using S at the

    Two estimates, the larger (more conservative) FAP is used:

      residual periodogram (Vaughan 2005), including red noise aliased by the sampling
      window (``alias_centres``, :func:`window_alias_centres`); valid for any sampling.
    * :func:`multiharmonic_fap` with the effective number of independent points of the
      residuals (:func:`residual_effective_n`), whenever the data form at least
      :data:`MIN_VISITS_EFFECTIVE_N` short visits at this frequency (:func:`_clustered_or_sparse`):
      sparse sampling, or clustered sampling such as Gaia scans (1-3 transits within
      6 h) at long periods. (With dense sampling -- TESS sectors -- there are only a few
      "visits" and consecutive residuals of any imperfect model are correlated, so the
      lag-1 statistic would measure the model, not the noise.) In sparse, clustered
      sampling red noise concentrates in alias spikes that a local continuum does not
      capture, while its time correlation does. The estimate needs at least two effective
      points per model parameter (N_eff >= 2 (2K + 1)): with fewer, the residuals and their
      correlations are those of the fit itself, and the F test has almost no residual degrees
      of freedom -- the misfit of a K-harmonic model to a sharp light curve, identical within
      a visit, gave strictly periodic Gaia Cepheids and binaries N_eff = 4-14 of 37-44 epochs
      and FAP = 1 (Gaia DR3 2686850313960864256, 5690870910317297408). The continuum estimate
      alone is then used (``effective_n_applicable`` False).

    ``variance_inflation`` is the factor by which correlated residuals inflate the variance
    of the signal's Fourier coefficients -- and so of its frequency -- over the white-noise
    estimate *from the residual scatter*: max(continuum / white level, N / N_eff, 1). The
    continuum is in units of the stated errors, and so is the residuals' mean power level
    (their reduced chi^2, ``white_level``), so dividing removes any error-bar scale that a
    residual-based variance already contains (multiplying the residual variance by the raw
    continuum counted that scale twice); N / N_eff is scale-free.

    2016, MNRAS 461, 3145); a periodic source repeats. Cross-validated: each half's light
    curve (the adopted ``n_harmonics`` K, at most (n_half - 1)/4, i.e. two epochs per
    parameter -- or, when it predicts the other half better, the order 1/(2 x the half's
    largest phase gap) that half's coverage supports; unit rms; one phase reference) is the
    template for the *other* half, which is
    fitted with mean + A x template + B x its phase derivative -- only the amplitude (A, data
    units) and a phase offset (B). The shape seen in one half must predict the other: red
    noise fails, while a template fitted to all the data would correlate with each half by
    construction (tried: on damped random walks sampled like Gaia and ZTF, 25 of 37
    significant red-noise peaks then passed, against 5 of 37 cross-validated). A stable
    signal gives equal (A, B) in both halves (B ~ 0; a phase shift gives B of opposite signs).
    The halves' (A, B) are compared with chi^2 (2 dof); each half's covariance is its

    :func:`period_significance` (``variance_inflation``: red-noise excess over the residuals'

    uncertainty of the template it was fitted with: the other half's coefficient covariance
    propagated by Monte Carlo (:data:`COHERENCE_TEMPLATE_DRAWS` draws, fixed seed). A
    template fitted to a sparse half is uncertain where that half has no epochs, and without
    that term its misfit of a non-sinusoidal light curve was read as a phase change: a
    strictly periodic 0.8-mag saw-tooth with 3 mmag noise on the real Gaia times of four
    Cepheids was "incoherent" in 28 of 48 simulations (review), 14 of 48 with it (see also
    :func:`_require_cross_band_confirmation` for many-cycle signals). Each half's signal must
    itself be significant, with p <= that of a 3-sigma sinusoid amplitude (chi^2_2 = 9). A
    statistically significant difference is accepted as modulation of a periodic signal
    (``modulated``) when the signal is detected at >= :data:`COHERENCE_STRONG_SIGMA` in both
    halves and changed by at most :data:`COHERENCE_MAX_RELATIVE_CHANGE` of its size. Returns

    survey's best-determined series, see :func:`search_periods`) is applied instead of
    running the ladder on this series when given.

    1. The Lomb-Scargle peak is refined (multi-harmonic chi^2 within +-1.5 frequency
       resolution elements: a non-sinusoidal signal pulls the single-harmonic peak).
    2. Harmonic ladder: while consecutive cycles differ (:func:`parity_test` at >= 5
       sigma unless the odd harmonics of f/2 worsen the BIC by more than 10, or the odd
       harmonics improve the BIC by > 10 -- Kass & Raftery 1995 "very strong" -- and in
       either case an effect of >= 5 % of the amplitude),
       the period is doubled (up to 3 times: P/8 -> P) and refined again. This recovers
       binaries with unequal minima whose Lomb-Scargle peak lies at P/2 or P/4. Doubling
       is only tested while 2P fits >= 10 times into the baseline.
    3. A fold showing one narrow dip per cycle (:func:`eclipse_shape`) at least
       :data:`ECLIPSE_MIN_DOUBLING_DEPTH` deep is an eclipsing binary with equal minima:
       the period is doubled once more and the single-dip period reported as alternative
       (it is right only if one eclipse per orbit is visible). A shallower single dip is
       transit-like: P is kept and 2P reported as the alternative. A symmetric fold
       (:func:`symmetry_index` < 0.05) keeps P and reports 2P as the alternative
       (ellipsoidal/contact binary with equal minima).
    4. Final multi-harmonic refinement (up to 20 harmonics, for narrow eclipses) with
       Montgomery & O'Donoghue errors, widened to the alias spacing when a sampling gap
       makes the cycle count ambiguous (:func:`alias_comb`).
    5. Significance (:func:`period_significance`): multi-harmonic FAP against the local
       noise continuum of the residuals and, for sparse sampling, with the effective
       number of independent points -- removing the white-noise assumption that made
       red-noise AGN look periodic; a phase-coherence check below 20 cycles; then

    periodogram is computed once and reused for that survey's multi-band sum (the
    reported multi-band result is that of the survey with the most epochs). Errors
    follow the calibrated survey error model.

    Each series' peak then goes through :func:`_finalise_period`: the period ladder
    (cycle parity and eclipse shape, tested jointly on the survey's decisive bands --
    never on Gaia BP/RP), multi-harmonic refinement and a false-alarm probability that
    accounts for correlated residuals (red noise).

    A per-series peak is ``reliable`` when its FAP < 1 % (and its outlier-robust,
    rank-based FAP too, :func:`rank_fap`), the baseline covers >= 5
    cycles (and the signal is phase-coherent between the halves of the data for < 20
    cycles), it is not a diurnal/annual sampling alias (ground-based surveys), a Gaia
    scanning-law frequency (Gaia) or a daily alias of a stronger peak in another band,

    coherent between the halves of the data (:func:`_require_cross_band_confirmation`) --
    and -- when ``variability`` is given -- the series itself is variable. Before that
    gate, ``variability`` is updated in place by :func:`_apply_periodic_evidence`. The

    The search is bounded in time: once ``time_budget_s`` (default
