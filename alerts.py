"""Live transient alert ingestion (ALeRCE, Fink/ZTF, Fink/LSST) with automatic crossmatch enrichment.

Brokers (public REST APIs, verified live 2026-09-28):

* **ALeRCE** (Foerster et al. 2021, AJ 161, 242) -- ``https://api.alerce.online/ztf/v1``.
  ``GET /objects/`` takes ``classifier``, ``class``, ``ranking``, ``probability``,
  ``firstmjd``/``lastmjd`` (repeated twice = [min, max] range), ``page``/``page_size``
  (at least 1000 rows per page), ``count``, ``order_by``/``order_mode`` (swagger at
  ``/ztf/v1/swagger.json``). It answers one row per *classifier version* that ranks the class
  first (live: ZTF18actadei twice for lc_classifier AGN, 0.84372 and 0.497556); rows are merged per
  object, pages being read until ``limit + 1`` distinct objects are seen, and every kept object is
  classified by its *newest* classifier version (``/objects/{oid}/probabilities``): an object whose
  only row comes from a superseded version that the newest one no longer ranks in the requested
  class (live: 2 of 15 lc_classifier AGN objects are Blazar / CV-Nova in lc_classifier_1.1.13) is
  dropped with a warning, and a stored row of it (stored while the version lookup failed, or before
  ALeRCE re-ranked it) takes the newest version's class with ``classifier_choice`` 'superseded'. Rows sharing an MJD (one ZTF exposure: live, up to 11 of 40 rows) come in a different
  order on every request, so ``page`` offsets can split, skip or repeat them: the pages are read
  by *keyset* instead -- each next request ends at the exact MJD of the previous page's last row
  (the bounds are inclusive; verified with the full-precision value), so every row of an object
  is seen whenever its exposure's rows fit in one page (``page`` offsets are used only inside a
  larger tie). Positions are the object mean (``meanra``/``meandec``). The
  photometry of the alert is the object's latest detection from
  ``GET /objects/{oid}/detections`` (``magpsf``, ``sigmapsf``, ``fid``, ``isdiffpos``,
  ``candid``); ``/magstats`` is not used because its ``maglast`` silently includes
  negative-subtraction detections (verified: ZTF18abablcx, r maglast = an isdiffpos -1
  detection). Early classes come from the stamp classifier (Carrasco-Davis et al. 2021,
  AJ 162, 231); light-curve classes from the hierarchical random forest (Sanchez-Saez et
  al. 2021, AJ 161, 141).
* **Fink/ZTF** (Moller et al. 2021, MNRAS 501, 3272) -- ``https://api.ztf.fink-portal.org/api/v1``
  (the former ``api.fink-portal.org`` host no longer answers). ``/latests`` returns the
  newest ``n`` alerts (sorted by ``i:jd``, newest first; verified) of a Fink class between
  ``startdate`` and ``stopdate``. Dates must be ISO UTC strings with 1 s resolution and are
  compared with the exact alert time (verified: a stopdate 0.997 s before an alert excludes
  it): MJD/JD values are documented but answer HTTP 500 (verified), and ``v:`` (derived)
  columns cannot be requested via ``columns`` (HTTP 500), so the class is the requested one.
  ``class`` also accepts SIMBAD classes without their ``(SIMBAD) `` prefix (verified with
  ``RRLyrae``). Class scores follow the Fink filter definitions in
  ``fink_filters/ztf/livestream/*/filter.py``: SN candidate = SuperNNova
  (Moller & de Boissiere 2020) ``snn_snia_vs_nonia`` or ``snn_sn_vs_all`` > 0.5, and its
  probability is ``snn_sn_vs_all`` (the Ia-vs-non-Ia score is a subclass score among SNe); Early
  SN Ia = ``rf_snia_vs_nonia`` (Leoni et al. 2022, A&A 663, A13); Kilonova =
  ``rf_kn_vs_nonkn`` (Biswas et al. 2023); Microlensing = LIA ``mulens`` (Godines et al. 2019).
* **Fink/LSST** -- ``https://api.lsst.fink-portal.org/api/v1`` ``/tags`` (Rubin alerts,
  schema lsst.v11), sorted by ``midpointMjdTai`` newest first; ``startdate``/``stopdate``
  are compared with ``midpointMjdTai`` itself (a TAI time; verified), so the UTC window is
  converted to TAI. Tags whose ``/tags`` listing says ``"API support": false`` answer
  HTTP 400 and are rejected as invalid input. ``psfFlux`` is the difference-image PSF flux
  in nJy (schema doc); it is converted to an AB magnitude with the Oke & Gunn (1983, ApJ 266,
  713) definition m_AB = -2.5 log10(f_nu / erg s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1) - 48.60, i.e.
  m = 31.4 - 2.5 log10(f / nJy) (48.60 corresponds to 3630.8 Jy). ``midpointMjdTai`` is
  converted TAI -> UTC. CATS broad classes (Fraga et al. 2024, arXiv:2404.08798) are taken
  from ``clf_cats_class``.

**Negative detections.** A difference-image detection can be negative (the source was
brighter in the reference image). For every broker ``magpsf`` is the magnitude of the
*absolute* difference flux (the ZTF convention; for LSST computed from |psfFlux|) and
``is_negative`` carries the sign (ZTF ``isdiffpos`` 'f'/'0'/-1, LSST ``isNegative``), so a
fading variable star is never shown as a brightening.

**Complete ingestion.** ``limit`` caps the alerts stored per poll. Every broker is asked for
``limit + 1`` objects newest first (Fink pages further back in time when several alerts
belong to one object), so an over-full window is detected, never silently cut: the poll
reports ``truncated`` with the MJD ``boundary`` below which alerts were not fetched, and a
default-window poll (``alerts watch``) records the unfetched part as a *backlog* window in
the ``alert_cursors`` table and ingests it on the following polls before moving on. A row with
a malformed value is skipped (or a malformed field left empty) with a warning; an alert whose
photometry request failed is stored without photometry and filled in by a later poll.

Every stored alert is auto-crossmatched with :class:`crossmatch.CrossmatchService`
(bounded concurrency) in a small cone (default 2") against Gaia DR3, SIMBAD and NED, plus a
host-galaxy search. Enrichment:

* ``host``: galaxies are searched with a *server-side* galaxy-type filter (SIMBAD ``otype``,
  NED ``prefphytype``) within the host radius (default 60"), so stars and HII regions cannot
  use up the row limit, and in HyperLEDA (Paturel et al. 2003, A&A 412, 45; VizieR VII/237;
  every PGC type: galaxies 'G', galaxies in multiple systems 'GM' and multiple systems 'M',
  e.g. M86, IC 10) for galaxies within 4 D25 semi-major axes of the alert (up to 6 deg away,
  covering the LMC; 168 grossly wrong 2003 sizes -- NGC 5078's 51' D25 is 2.6' -- are replaced by the
  current HyperLEDA ones). The host follows the directional light radius (DLR) method of Sullivan
  et al. (2006, ApJ 648, 868) and Gupta et al. (2016, AJ 152, 154): d_DLR = separation / r(theta),
  with r the D25 ellipse radius toward the alert (HyperLEDA's B1950 position angles are
  precessed to ICRS). The alert is assigned to the galaxy with the smallest d_DLR <= 2 D25 radii
  (Gupta's d_DLR < 4 is in second-moment radii, ~half the D25 radius): inside its ellipse (SN 2014J
  -> M82, 58" from its nucleus) or outside it (SN 2023bee -> NGC 2708 at 1.48, SN 2018aoz -> NGC 3923
  at 1.45); galaxies at 2 < d_DLR <= 4 are reported as possible associations only. A D25 galaxy
  whose redshift differs from the transient's own catalogued redshift (its SIMBAD/NED entry, or the
  broker's TNS redshift) by > 3000 km/s is a foreground/background projection, not the host (PTF
  10hv, z = 0.052, on M101), and a host-cone galaxy without a D25 size takes precedence when it is
  at another redshift and the alert lies within its (typical, 8 kpc) light radius (PTF 11dws, 0.8"
  from a z = 0.15 galaxy on M106), or -- at the same or an unknown redshift -- when it lies outside
  the D25 ellipse, nearer than its light radius and is not a likely chance alignment. Without a D25
  galaxy, a host-cone galaxy is adopted (method 'nearest') only when it is not a likely chance
  alignment: its redshift agrees with the transient's, or its chance-coincidence probability (Bloom
  et al. 2002; from the cone's local galaxy density) is <= 0.1 -- never when it lies beyond 2 typical
  (8 kpc) light radii at its redshift, and lying within one is no evidence by itself (the galaxy may be
  a 1 kpc dwarf: blank points 50" from a z = 0.005 dwarf); otherwise ``host_status`` is 'unassociated'
  (12 of 20 random blank positions had a 'found' host before, 2 now). An alert on a catalogued AGN /
  QSO / blazar (within the match radius) is that active nucleus: its galaxy is the host (method
  'agn_nucleus', or its D25 galaxy, e.g. Mrk 421) and its redshift the transient's, so no neighbour at
  another redshift is adopted (3C 273, z = 0.158, is not hosted by a z = 0.0053 dwarf 10.8" away).
  Elsewhere in the cone quasars, blazars and pair/group entries are never hosts (SN 2016bam's host was
  a z = 2.06 QSO 15" away), nor entries named only by a transient designation
  (NED lists e.g. the CV 'AT 2017abr' as a galaxy: ``ambiguous_transient_entry``). Host names
  prefer major catalogues (Messier, NGC, IC, UGC, PGC...) over fibre/sub-component entries and
  transient-host labels ('SN 1994I HOST').
  The projected offset in kpc uses a redshift-independent Cosmicflows-4 distance (Tully et
  al. 2023, ApJ 944, 94) for hosts with z < 0.01 or no redshift (e.g. SN 1987A -> LMC,
  1.0 kpc), else the CF4 distance of the host's group (Tully 2015, AJ 149, 171 membership; e.g.
  M100 and M86 -> Virgo, 16.2 Mpc), else the Hubble-flow distances of the CMB-frame redshift --
  the group's CMB velocity when the host is in a group -- in a flat LCDM cosmology with the Planck
  2018 densities (Planck Collaboration 2020, A&A 641, A6) and CF4's H0 = 74.6 km/s/Mpc (one
  distance scale: no jump where the method changes), uncertain by ~v_pec / cz (300 km/s, or the
  group's velocity dispersion); below
  cz_CMB = 1500 km/s without a CF4 distance no offset is given (None, with the reason in the
  evidence). Truncated cones or failed catalogs make the search ``incomplete`` (never a false
  ``none_within_radius``).
* ``known_star`` means *Galactic* star. The astrometry of a Gaia DR3 counterpart is first
  vetted: it is not a star's when its parallax is < -3 sigma, when a SIMBAD/NED galaxy/AGN/cluster
  entry lies within 1.5" and the single-star model fits it poorly -- a galaxy nucleus, AGN or star
  cluster, whose formally significant proper motions are spurious (M87 7.5 mas/yr at 12 sigma,
  NGC 3783 0.24 mas/yr at 15 sigma) --, or when Gaia's DSC gives P(galaxy) + P(quasar) > 0.5
  (Delchambre et al. 2023) or it is a Gaia galaxy candidate *and* it fits poorly or its evidence
  is marginal (< 20-sigma proper motion and < 10-sigma parallax): DSC's classes have a low purity,
  and a white dwarf with a 100-sigma parallax is DSC-extragalactic. Otherwise it is Galactic when
  its parallax / parallax_error >= 5 (Bailer-Jones 2015, PASP 127, 994) -- projected on a D25
  ellipse only if >= 10 sigma, or G < 19, or RUWE < 1.4 (Rybizki et al. 2022, MNRAS 510, 2597;
  Lindegren et al. 2021, A&A 649, A2); when its proper motion (>= 5 sigma) exceeds 750 km/s at the
  associated host's distance (3.2 mas/yr at the LMC distance when unknown; any significant motion when
  no galaxy is associated with or under the alert and it lies far from the Magellanic Clouds, M31, M33
  and the Local Group dwarfs) and it is a well-behaved
  point source (RUWE < 1.4, excess-noise significance <= 2) or the motion is >= 20 sigma (a binary's);
  or when it *is* a catalogued star (stellar-type entry at its position, no galaxy/cluster entry
  within 1.5") inside a galaxy of known distance with M_G < -10 (Humphreys & Davidson 1979), whatever
  its excess noise (bright stars on M31's disc have huge excess noise). The broker's own Gaia xmatch parallax (no RUWE/G) counts at >= 5
  sigma outside galaxies and >= 10 sigma inside them (never for a broker galaxy/AGN match), and
  defers to the counterpart search's row of the same source. NED '!'-prefixed (Milky Way)
  stellar types are Galactic, NED 'exG*' extragalactic. Without such evidence, a stellar-type
  source inside a galaxy with |z| < 0.01 (D < ~43 Mpc, the distance to which individual stars --
  Cepheids, novae, X-ray binaries -- are catalogued, cf. the SH0ES Cepheid hosts, Riess et al.
  2022, ApJL 934, L7) is an *extragalactic* star (``known_star`` False, e.g. M31N 2008-12a,
  IC 10 X-1 or an M82 X-ray binary); outside every D25 ellipse but associated with (d_DLR <= 2),
  or within the host radius of, such a nearby galaxy the answer is unknown (None, e.g. the SN
  impostor SN 2009ip near NGC 7259); inside a galaxy of unknown redshift unknown (None); far from
  any galaxy, Galactic -- except within the stellar extent of a Local Group dwarf (McConnachie 2012
  half-light radii, not the D25 ellipse a dwarf spheroidal barely reaches: Sculptor's is 34"): within
  3 r_h one of its stars (False, e.g. the Sculptor RR Lyrae EV* SclG V0214), up to 6 r_h unknown. A
  NED '*' entry ("star or point source": often the transient's own earlier detection) is the only
  stellar evidence of a transient with a host only when Gaia DR3 detected a point source there (else
  None: SN 2002gn, SN 2018aks); a generic stellar entry (SIMBAD '*', NED '*') within 1.5" of a
  galaxy/AGN entry is another entry of the galaxy's nucleus, not a star, unless a well-behaved,
  non-extragalactic Gaia DR3 point source confirms it (SIMBAD 'LEDA 1798300' '*' on a z = 0.027
  galaxy). A well-behaved Gaia DR3 point source at the alert that DSC calls a star (P >= 0.9) or that
  moves (>= 5 sigma), without decisive astrometry, makes the answer unknown (None), never False -- unless
  Gaia classifies it as extragalactic, its parallax is < -3 sigma or a catalogued galaxy/AGN/cluster lies
  on it (a BL Lac such as PKS 2155-304 is a well-fitted point source with DSC P(star) ~ 1).
  ``stellar_counterpart`` reports the stellar-type match itself.
* ``known_variable``: a catalogued variable source at the position (SIMBAD variable-star
  ``otypedef`` types, codes and labels including '_Candidate' labels as emitted by Fink,
  blazars, NED ``V*``/``Nova``/``Flare*``, the broker's Gaia DR3 variability flag); it may be
  extragalactic (the evidence says so). ``known_agn``: a catalogued AGN/QSO/Seyfert/blazar at
  the position (SIMBAD 'G > AGN' types, NED 'QSO', the broker's SIMBAD match) -- AGN flares are
  the main 'known variable' contaminant of extragalactic alert streams.
* ``is_new``: no catalogued source other than the transient itself within the match radius;
  None unless every match catalog answered. The transient itself is an entry of a transient
  type (SN, GRB, GW event...) or with a transient designation (SN/AT/TNS or survey names)
  that the catalogue does not type as a star or variable: catalogued CVs and novae with
  discovery names ('MASTER OT J...', 'PNV J...', 'ZTF18aayefwp' CV*) are prior sources.

An enrichment is ``done`` when every query answered, ``partial`` when some failed (flags
that depend on a failed catalog are None) and ``failed`` when no counterpart catalog
answered; ``partial``/``failed`` rows are retried by later polls and the retry sweep with a
backoff (5 min after the first incomplete attempt, doubling, at most 6 h). Attempts that failed
only because services were unreachable (timeouts, network errors, HTTP 5xx/429) do not count
towards ``MAX_CROSSMATCH_ATTEMPTS``; after that many real failures an alert is retried once a day
(``alerts crossmatch`` re-runs any alert at once). A failed retry never overwrites an earlier
complete result, and an enrichment of a position the alert has since left keeps it 'pending'.
Batch enrichments share one ``concurrency``-slot semaphore per service; a re-crossmatch request
skips the queue.

Alerts persist in the SQLite (or PostgreSQL) metadata database used by
:class:`datasets.MetadataStore` (``ALERTS_DATABASE_URL`` overrides it for both the API and
the CLI), in tables ``alerts`` and ``alert_cursors`` owned by this module, deduplicated on
``broker:object_id``; polling is idempotent and an older detection never replaces a newer one.

        Galaxy entries named only by a transient designation (or one of the alert's own designations) are
        never adopted: the catalogue may list the transient itself as a galaxy (e.g. NED 'AT 2017abr',
        type G, for a Galactic CV); when they are the only candidates ``host_status`` is
        'ambiguous_transient_entry'. When galaxies were found but none passes, ``host_status`` is

        motion < 20 sigma and parallax < 10 sigma). DSC's galaxy and quasar classes have a low purity
        (Delchambre et al. 2023) and blue stars (white dwarfs, CVs, hot subdwarfs) and foreground stars on
        bright galaxies fall in them: a well-fitted source with a 100-sigma parallax or a 900-sigma proper
        motion is a star (the white dwarf WDJ153053.31+690231.98, DSC-extragalactic). Then:

        * parallax >= 5 sigma: outside galaxies always; projected on a D25 ellipse when >= 10 sigma,
          or G < 19, or RUWE < 1.4;
        * proper motion >= 5 sigma and faster than 750 km/s at the distance of the associated host
          (3.2 mas/yr at the LMC's when unknown; any when no galaxy is associated or under the alert, far
          from NEARBY_GALAXY_REACH and the Local Group dwarfs, unless a catalogued AGN/QSO/galaxy or a redshift
          >= EXTRAGALACTIC_MIN_REDSHIFT lies on the source or its excess noise is significant: then 3.2 mas/yr),
          for a well-behaved point source -- or, whatever its
          RUWE/excess noise, at >= 20 sigma when nothing marks the source as extragalactic (DSC, galaxy
          candidate): a binary's proper motion (the eclipsing binary Gaia DR3 6189441739218449664, RUWE
          5.1, 11 mas/yr at 31 sigma) is real, while the spurious ones of nuclei and clusters stay < 18 sigma;
        * at the distance of the associated host: the Gaia source *is* a catalogued star (a SIMBAD/NED
          stellar-type entry within 0.5" after the J2000 -> J2016 drift), no galaxy/AGN/cluster entry lies
          within 1.5" of it, and M_G = G - DM < -10 (Humphreys & Davidson 1979) -- whatever its RUWE or
          excess noise: bright stars on a galaxy's disc have huge excess noise (the long-period variable
          [WWV2004] J0043124+404639, G = 11.0, would be M_G = -13.3 in M31).
