"""High-throughput batch crossmatch: one archive request per catalog (per chunk) instead of one per target.

A list of targets ``[{id, ra, dec, epoch?, pm_ra_masyr?, pm_dec_masyr?, parallax_mas?, radius_arcsec?}]`` is
matched against each requested catalog with the cheapest protocol the archive supports:

``upload``
    IVOA TAP 1.1 table upload (Dowler et al. 2019, "Table Access Protocol Version 1.1", IVOA Recommendation,
    Sect. 2.5.4 UPLOAD; ADQL 2.0, Ortiz et al. 2008, Sect. 2.4 geometric functions). The target list is sent as
    an inline VOTable (``UPLOAD=targets,param:targets``, multipart/form-data) and joined server-side::

        SELECT tu.t_idx, <catalog columns> FROM <catalog table>, TAP_UPLOAD.targets AS tu
        WHERE 1 = CONTAINS(POINT('ICRS', ra, dec), CIRCLE('ICRS', tu.t_ra, tu.t_dec, tu.t_rad))

    Every target carries its own cone (``t_ra, t_dec, t_rad``) from :func:`models.plan_cone`, so epoch-aware
    cones (proper-motion propagation / epoch widening) are exactly those of the per-target cone search.
    Verified live (2026-09-28) with a column-valued CIRCLE radius on SIMBAD TAP, VizieR TAP, HEASARC Xamin TAP
    and IRSA TAP. Service particulars (all verified against live responses):

    * SIMBAD (https): TAPRegExt capabilities declare ``uploadLimit`` 200000 rows and ``outputLimit`` 50000
      (default) / 2000000 (hard) rows.
    * VizieR TAP: uploads only work over ``http://tapvizier.cds.unistra.fr`` (the https endpoint used for cone
      queries rejects multipart uploads); ``uploadLimit`` 100000 rows.
    * IRSA TAP: only the comma (cross-join + WHERE) form is accepted -- ``JOIN ... ON CONTAINS(...)`` returns
      ``UsageFault: BAD_REQUEST`` -- and TAP/sync has a 5-minute execution limit (capabilities comment), so
      chunks are kept small. Upload columns are plain ASCII names (IRSA rejects unicode columns and reserved
      names such as ``uid``).
    * HEASARC Xamin: result columns of a join are prefixed with the table name (``first_ra``) unless aliased,
      so every selected column is given an explicit ``AS`` alias. The target index is uploaded as a 32-bit
      ``int``: Xamin returns BINARY-serialised VOTables and a 64-bit ``long`` column with its null sentinel
      (-9223372036854775808) overflows astropy's C ``long`` parser on Windows.

``xmatch``
    The CDS XMatch service (Boch, Pineau & Derriere 2012, ASP Conf. Ser. 461, 291;
    http://cdsxmatch.u-strasbg.fr/xmatch/doc/API-calls.html) cross-matches an uploaded CSV with any VizieR
    table (``cat2=vizier:<table>``), returning every pair within ``distMaxArcsec`` (at most 180 arcsec; uploads
    at most 100 MB; ``MAXREC`` hard limit 2000000). Used for Gaia DR3 (``vizier:I/355/gaiadr3``) because the ESA
    Gaia archive does not complete anonymous synchronous uploads. VizieR I/355 positions are the Gaia DR3
    ``ra``/``dec`` at Ep=2016.0 (I/355 ReadMe: "RAdeg ... Right ascension (ICRS) at Ep=2016.0"); its columns
    are renamed to the Gaia archive names used by the registry (``Source`` -> ``source_id``, ``e_RAdeg`` ->
    ``ra_error`` in mas, ...) so rows are normalised exactly like the cone-search rows. Any other VizieR table
    can be requested as a catalog named ``vizier:<table>`` (e.g. ``vizier:II/349/ps1``); the tables in
    :data:`VIZIER_VIEWS` (2MASS PSC, AllWISE, PS1 DR1, SDSS DR16) carry their identifier, epoch and
    positional-error conventions and share their registry survey's association priors (sky density, density-map
    scaling, resolution); other tables are described by :func:`describe_generic_answer`: positions are the ones
    XMatch matched on -- VizieR's computed ``_RAJ2000``/``_DEJ2000`` (Hipparcos' ``meta.main`` columns are at
    J1991.25) or the table's ``meta.main`` columns --, dated J2000.0 for rows with a proper motion when that
    position is at J2000 (``_RAJ2000``; UCAC4/USNO-B1.0/NOMAD/PPMXL ``RAJ2000``, URAT1 ``RA2000``, Gaia DR2/EDR3
    ``ra_epoch2000``; a mean observation epoch column never re-dates them); identifiers the ``meta.id;meta.main``
    column, the ``meta.id.part;meta.main`` parts (Tycho-2 TYC1-TYC2-TYC3) or an identifier-like bare ``meta.id``
    (Gaia ``source_id``); positional errors XMatch's 1-sigma ellipse, else its circular ``radec_err``. Their
    cones are planned for J2000 (:func:`_planning_catalog`), the epoch XMatch matches them at. XMatch declares
    some string columns shorter than their values (USNO-B1.0, NOMAD1.0: arraysize 12 for 13 characters): the
    declared sizes are relaxed before parsing (:func:`_relax_char_arraysize`) so identifiers are never cut.

    ``distMaxArcsec`` is one value per request, so targets are grouped by cone radius into geometric buckets
    (a new bucket starts when a radius exceeds :data:`XMATCH_RADIUS_BUCKET_RATIO` times the bucket's smallest):
    targets with individual epochs, proper motions or radii still share O(log(r_max/r_min)) requests, and every
    target's rows are then cut back to its own cone with the ``angDist`` XMatch measured. A cone wider than 180"
    (epoch widening) is cone-searched when the catalog has a registry cone search (``fallback_to_cone``, at most
    ``BATCH_MAX_CONE_TARGETS``); otherwise a cone widened for an unknown proper motion is capped at 180" with a
    warning, and a proper-motion track that does not fit is refused with its reason (never sent upstream).

``cone``
    Archives without upload support (NED, the NASA Exoplanet Archive, MAST Pan-STARRS, SDSS SkyServer) are
    queried with the regular per-target cone search through :class:`crossmatch.QueryExecutor` (including its
    fallbacks) with bounded concurrency; each endpoint is paced by the :class:`providers.EndpointGuard` shared
    with the API's own providers (``app.state.providers``) when the router runs inside the API.

Rows of every strategy are converted with the providers' own row pipeline (``normalize_source_record`` with
the UCD metadata of the response, the catalog's positional-error and epoch specifications, epoch-corrected
separations). Each target's rows of all catalogs are then finalised by
:meth:`crossmatch.CrossmatchService.finalize` -- the single-object pipeline: proper-motion / parallax adoption
from matched rows, final in-radius split, and the NWAY-style Bayesian association (Budavari & Szalay 2008, ApJ
679, 301; Salvato et al. 2018, MNRAS 473, 4937). A batch match's ``confidence`` is therefore the same posterior
probability that the row is the target's counterpart that a single-object search over the same catalogs
reports (it depends on which catalogs are matched together, exactly as there). Matches are ranked nearest
first with SIMBAD host stars ahead of planets listed at the same position (:func:`providers.source_sort_key`).

Large lists are chunked (per-service chunk sizes below; upload and XMatch chunks shrink with the cone area so
wide cones do not overflow), each chunk is retried on transient failures (connection resets and connect
timeouts, HTTP 408/429/5xx, honouring Retry-After), a chunk whose answer hit the row or byte limit (QUERY_STATUS
OVERFLOW -- detected before parsing --, ``MAXREC`` rows, :data:`MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`) or whose request timed out
twice on the server side (read/write timeout) is split in two and re-sent, and a chunk that still fails for a
transient reason falls back to per-target cone searches (a deterministic HTTP 4xx query error does not: it
would fail identically for every target). Each catalog has a time budget (``BATCH_CATALOG_BUDGET_SECONDS``);
targets left when it runs out are reported as failed. Every failed (target, catalog) pair carries its own
reason, also in the flat outputs (``status`` "failed" rows), so a failed query is never read as "no
counterpart". Request counts, retries and wall times are reported per catalog. CPU-bound steps (planning,
parsing, conversion, association, serialisation) run one at a time in a worker thread (:func:`_offload`), in
short time slices served least-CPU-used request first (:func:`_offload_steps`), so a small request is not held
up by a large batch; the REST handler cancels a batch whose client disconnected, which stops its CPU work after
the running slice. The batch routes enforce their own body limit (``BATCH_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES``) while streaming;
an application-wide body-size middleware must exempt them (:func:`owns_request_body_limit`).

        ``attempts`` times with exponential backoff (Retry-After honoured up to 30 s) and count as endpoint
        failures for the circuit breaker. CDS XMatch resets roughly one connection in six under load (observed
        live 2026-09-28 with curl and httpx alike), so a few retries are routine. A read/write timeout (the

        reports to the circuit breaker at most once, cancellation included; a timed-out multi-target join is not
        reported as an endpoint failure (it is too heavy, and is split), unless it was the half-open recovery
        probe.
